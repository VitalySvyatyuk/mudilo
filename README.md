bad driver

The app collects info about 'bad drivers'. Responsible and proactive drivers register such drivers and send their license numbers to our system. The system, based on the data, makes a decision - is driver mudilo or not. 

## ToDo:
- add collapsed header
- add gen_data
- add plate validation
- restrict requests to 5 per day (create and get)
- add translation {% trans %}
- get user's location
- add ElasticSearch
